    "1. Retrieve the data on London rent prices and cleaned it.\n",

    "4. Create dummy variables for London venue types and calculated frequency scores for each venue grouped by London area.\n",
    "5. Merge the resulting dataframe with the London rent prices dataframe to get one dataframe with London rent prices and venue frequency scores.\n",
    "6. Get stakeholder's criteria in the form of a dictionary.\n",
    "7. Find similar venues to \"Must Have\" venues in criteria.\n",
    "8. Find areas which have at least one of the similar venues within 2 km for each \"Must Have\" venue.\n",
    "9. Print the result as a dataframe.\n",
    "10. Plot the points on a map.\n",
